# Advent of Code :christmas_tree: :santa: :computer:
Solutions (in rust) to advent of code.

## Running the code

Running the solutions require the crate [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) to be installed. After setup, navigate into the desired year and run ...
```
user@home(advent-of-code) $ cd aoc_2018
user@home(aoc_2018) $ cargo aoc
```
... to find all the answers given the included [input files](aoc_2018/input/2018/). Alternatively, one can choose to run a specific day and part ...
```
user@home(aoc_2018) $ cargo aoc -d {day} -p {part}
```

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue! :gift:
